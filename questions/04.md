# Question 5

When should we use a set?&nbsp;

## Correct

To store a collection of&nbsp; **unique** &nbsp;values

> Correct! Since the algorithm needs to iterate through each letter of the input,
> the time complexity will grow in linear proportion to the size of the input.

## Incorrect

To store key value pairs.

> Not quite. A Dictionary would be better for this use case.

## Incorrect

When we need a FIFO(First in first out) data structure?&nbsp;

> Not quite. A set does not maintain insertion order.&nbsp;
