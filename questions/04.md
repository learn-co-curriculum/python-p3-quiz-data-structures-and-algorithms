# Question 5

When should we use a set?

## Correct

To store a collection of **unique** values.

> Correct! Since the algorithm needs to iterate through each letter of the input,
> the time complexity will grow in linear proportion to the size of the input.

## Incorrect

To store key value pairs.

> Not quite. A Dictionary would be better for this use case.

## Incorrect

When we need a FIFO(First in first out) data structure?

> Not quite. A set does not maintain insertion order.
