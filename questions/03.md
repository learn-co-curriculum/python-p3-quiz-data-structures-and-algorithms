# Question 4

Calculate the&nbsp; **time complexity** &nbsp;for the following code using Big O
notation:

```python
def append(self, node):
  if self.head == None:
    self.head = node
    return
  last_node = self.head
  while last_node.next_node:
    last_node = last_node.next_node
  last_node.next_node = node
```

## Incorrect

O(1)

> Not quite! Is there a loop somewhere in the code?&nbsp;

## Correct

O(n)

> Yes we are using a while loop to look through the list. There are `n` nodes in
> the list so the worst case runtime is `O(n)`

## Incorrect

O(n<sup>2</sup>)

> Not quite! The code does not seem to be using nested loops.&nbsp;
